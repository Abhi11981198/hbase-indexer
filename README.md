HBase Indexer
=============

HBase Indexer allows you to easily and quickly index HBase rows into Solr.
Usage documentation can be found on the hbase-indexer Wiki -
http://github.com/NGDATA/hbase-indexer/wiki.


## Building the binary distribution

Use the following command to build the binary distribution (.tar.gz & rpm):

    mvn -DskipTests -Pdist install


## Getting Started

These steps assume a running HBase 0.94.x installation (preferably CDH 4.2),
as well as a running Solr installation. For this example, the configured Solr
schema will need to have a multi-valued field called "data", as well as a
unique key field called "id".

1. Enable replication and other settings that are outlined in the
   [hbase-sep demo instructions](https://github.com/NGDATA/hbase-sep/blob/master/demo/README.md)

2. Unzip the binary distribution (instructions for creating the binary
   distribution are listed above).

        $ tar zxvf hbase_indexer.tar.gz

3. Copy the hbase-sep jar files from the lib directory of the binary
   distribution into the lib directory of HBase.
   
        $ cd hbase_indexer
        $ sudo cp lib/hbase-sep-* /usr/lib/hbase/lib

4. Create a table in HBase that has replication enabled. For this example,
   we'll create a table called "record" with a single column family called 'data'.

        hbase> create 'record', {NAME => 'data', REPLICATION_SCOPE => 1}

5. Start the hbase-indexer server

        $ ./bin/hbase-indexer server

6. Create an indexer definition. For this example, we'll just index anything
   in the data column family into the "data" field in Solr. Save the below
   contents in a file called 'sample.xml'.

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <indexer table="record">
          <field name="data" value="data:*" type="string"/>
        </indexer>
   
7. Add the indexer definition to the indexer server. The following command
   assumes that the Solr ZooKeeper is running on the current host, and the
   name of the collection to be used for indexing is "core0".

        $ ./bin/hbase-indexer add-indexer  -n sampleindex -c sample.xml --cp solr.collection=core0 

8. Add some data to the record table in HBase. The data added to the data
   column family in the record table should show up in the Solr index.

        hbase> put 'record', 'row1', 'data:value', 'Test of HBase Indexer'
